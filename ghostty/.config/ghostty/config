# Ok so this is all helix-specific. Because I can't send Cmd+[a ton of keys]
# to tmux, I'm sending keycodes for intermediary shortcuts that tmux understands
# and converts to default helix shortcuts. So in a way, configuring helix custom
# shortcuts through ghostty & tmux keybindings.
# Is this a good thing? Probably not but I have to use this until a way to send
# cmd+* key presses to programs running inside tmux panes.
#
# One good thing is I'm able to configure tmux to only send these commands to
# the program if that program is helix.
